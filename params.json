{"name":"SJTU-Flow","tagline":"","body":"# An extensible framework for Fluid Simulation\r\nSJTU-Flow is an open-source framework targeted at fluid simulation research in Computer Graphics.\r\nIts paralellized C++ solver core, python scene definition interface and plugin system allow to quickly prototype and test new algorithms.\r\n# Features\r\nThe framework can be used with or without GUI on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Here is an incomplete list of features implemented so far:\r\n\r\n1. Eulerian simulation using MAC Grids, PCG pressure solver and MacCormack advection\r\n2. (Passive) particle systems\r\n3. FLIP advection\r\n4. Surface mesh support\r\n5. Free surface simulations with levelsets, fast marching\r\n6. Basic CUDA support\r\n7. Wavelet turbulence\r\n8. K-epsilon turbulence modeling and synthesis\r\n9. Vortex particles, vortex sheets\r\n\r\nCheck out the release notes for more detail. We have much larger codebase which has not been migrated so far due to copyright concerns and/or lazyness.\r\n\r\n# Pull Request\r\nEveryone who want to contribute yourself to this project is welcome.<br>\r\nPlease Follow the regulation of pull request of the Github\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
